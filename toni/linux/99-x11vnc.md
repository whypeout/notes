How to install x11vnc vnc server as a service on Ubuntu 20.04, for remote access or screen sharing
Hey All – revisiting an old one again here with an update for 20.04 (and also the versions in between (most probably).

So why you might want to do this is for remote access via a GUI, or screen sharing, or to a headless server, or virtual machine? Installing x11vnc from the gnome-software centre doesn’t ensure that it starts on boot without a graphical session being logged in each time the machine restarts, hence a slightly longer process is needed.

First of all lets do a
```
sudo apt-get update
```
First thing we need to do is change the display manager over to lightdm (away from gnome display manager 3).
```
sudo apt-get install lightdm
```
followed by a quick reboot
```
sudo reboot
```
and then
```
sudo apt-get install x11vnc
```
You can skip this step if you like but I would recommend running x11vnc from a terminal and trying to connect remotely. (this is insecure but it’s fine for testing on a LAN I guess.)

Creating a Secure Password for VNC Access
To ensure your x11vnc sessions are secure, it’s crucial to set up a password:
```
x11vnc -storepasswd
```
This command generates a password file located at /home/yourusername/.vnc/passwd. Make sure to replace yourusername with your actual username.

Next comes the service bit:
we need to create this file
```
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service
```
and copy paste in the following
```
[Unit]
Description=x11vnc service
After=display-manager.service network.target syslog.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -forever -display :0 -auth guess -passwd password
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
So what does this mean?

- `start` after some other services have been started / target points have been reached,
- `forking` as the x11vnc creates a child process from the `-forever` clause.
- the `ExecStart` and `Stop` commands should be self explanatory,
- we want it to be `restarted on failure`,
- we also want the service to be started before the process reaches the multi-user target.
- Super – now we need to tell the systemd system there is a change and to reload `systemctl daemon-reload`, followed by enabling the new service `systemctl enable x11vnc.service`. While we’re there we may aswell start the service then test it `systemctl start x11vnc.service`.

You can check on the status of this service, like others, using `systemctl status x11vnc.service`.

One last test before calling it done is to reboot the system once again. It’s important to check that you can log in from the ‘login’ screen.

OH – A GOTYA – don’t lock the screen as you wont be able to VNC back in.
So change your `settings>privacy>screen lock` to the following.

So this isn’t so secure so you might need to install something called xscreensaver.

optionally:

Determining the Correct User ID (UID)
Knowing the correct UID, especially for systems that use a display manager (like GDM), is essential for setting up x11vnc as a systemd service. The UID helps reference the correct user’s Xauthority file for authentication. List sessions and their UIDs with loginctl:
```
loginctl
```
Identify the session related to your display manager (gdm often) and note the UID. In this example, 121 is the UID for gdm:
```
$ loginctl
SESSION  UID USER   SEAT  TTY  
     18 1000 user         pts/0
     c1  121 gdm    seat0 tty1

2 sessions listed.
```
using it with gdm as a service

.Xauthority
Set desktop to auto login and prevent screen locking .. else you will need to deal with Xauth

Test run x11vnc
/usr/local/bin/x11vnc -forever -display :0
Step 1: Create the Systemd Service File
Create x11vnc.service:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/x11vnc.service
Insert the following configuration, adjusting paths and the UID as needed:

```
[Unit]
Description=Start x11vnc at startup.
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment="DISPLAY=:0"
Environment="XAUTHORITY=/var/run/user/121/gdm/Xauthority"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -auth /var/run/user/121/gdm/Xauthority -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /home/user/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -shared
#with default gnome desktop : /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service
#ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -forever -display :0 -rfbauth /etc/x11vnc.pass -auth /run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
